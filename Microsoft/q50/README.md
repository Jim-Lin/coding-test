> Suppose an arithmetic expression is given as a binary tree. Each leaf is an integer and each internal node is one of '+', '−', '∗', or '/'.  
Given the root to such a tree, write a function to evaluate it.  
For example, given the following tree:

<pre>    *
   / \
  +    +
 / \  / \
3  2  4  5</pre>

> You should return 45, as it is (3 + 2) * (4 + 5).
