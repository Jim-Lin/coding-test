> Given a list of integers, write a function that returns the largest sum of non-adjacent numbers.
For example, [2, 4, 6, 8] should return 12, since we pick 4 and 8. [5, 1, 1, 5] should return 10, since we pick 5 and 5.

### example
```text
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]: 10

1, 3
1, 4
1, 5
1, 6

2, 4
2, 5
2, 6

3, 5
3, 6

4, 6
```
